Found this project incredibly difficult. I'm still enough of a novice at html and css that I lost probably too much time getting the varrious pages blocked out. Javascript I still find incredibly confusing even with turtorials and classwwork to look back on. This project does not meet the major requirements. I know I'm on the right track with a few of them but I'm at the point where the more I struggle the more things break. 

I have definitely at least learned a lesson about trying to do too much styling or js on a single file. Muultiiple files though seems to be problematic when deploying to git-pages. What I do have all works when viewed in vs code, but is mostly broken as deployed to github. I know the problem has to be with the directory structure but I can't figure out exactly what's wrong.
